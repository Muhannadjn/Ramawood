Build a fully functional, professional, and responsive one‚Äëpage website for RamaWood, a Swedish wood import and export company.

Note: I will provide the RamaWood logo, wood product images, and a hero background photo later. Please prepare placeholder slots so the images can be added easily.

üé® Visual & Design Guidelines:
Use a natural wood-inspired color palette: warm brown, forest green, beige, and clean white space.

Follow a minimalist, premium design aesthetic.

Take strong inspiration from https://wood.com, including:

Elegant scroll-based animations and soft transitions between sections.

Parallax effects on the hero background and product sections.

Animated text/image entrances (fade, slide, scale).

Scrollytelling-style effects (e.g. sticky or pinned text while scrolling).

Clean, modern typography and large visuals.

Subtle hover effects and smooth CTA interactions.

üì± Responsiveness & Language Support:
The site must be 100% mobile responsive across all devices.

Include a fully working language switcher for:

English (default)

Arabic (with full RTL layout and mirrored spacing)

Swedish

Text, layout, and direction must adjust seamlessly per language.
